I was invited to photograph an exhilarating fight night, capturing dynamic moments ringside. 

My goal was to document the intensity, emotion, and explosive action from each round. 

From the focused preparation backstage to the electric energy in the arena, I aimed to
tell a vivid visual story of determination, passion, and athletic prowess.
