I spent an incredible week exploring Keswick, hiking iconic peaks like Latrigg and Catbells,
and immersing myself in the breathtaking scenery of the Lake District. 

Each day brought memorable adventures, from capturing panoramic views over Derwentwater 
to wandering lush woodland trails, making it an unforgettable outdoor experience.
